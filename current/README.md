# The Archives Unleashed Toolkit: Latest Documentation

The Archives Unleashed Toolkit is an open-source platform for analyzing web archives built on [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/). Tight integration with Hadoop provides powerful tools for analytics and data processing via [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/).

Most of this documentation is built on [resilient distributed datasets (RDD)](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html). We are working on adding support for [DataFrames](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html#datasets-and-dataframes). You can read more about this in our experimental [DataFrames section](#dataframes), and at our [[Using the Archives Unleashed Toolkit with PySpark]] tutorial.

If you want to learn more about [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), we highly recommend [Spark: The Definitive Guide](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034957.do) 

## Table of Contents

Our documentation is divided into several main sections, which cover the Archives Unleashed Toolkit workflow from analyzing collections to understanding and working with the results.

- **[Image Analysis](https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut-docs-new/blob/master/current/image-analysis.md)**: How do I find the most frequent images in a collection by URL or MD5 hash.

### Filtering Results
- **[Filters](https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut-docs-new/blob/master/current/filters.md NOW)**: A variety of ways to filter results.

## Further Reading

The toolkit grew out of a previous project called [Warcbase](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase). The following article provides a nice overview, much of which is still relevant:
