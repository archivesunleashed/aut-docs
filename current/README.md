# The Archives Unleashed Toolkit: Latest Documentation

The Archives Unleashed Toolkit is an open-source platform for analyzing web
archives built on [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/), which provides
powerful tools for analytics and data processing.

This documentation is based on a cookbook approach, providing a series of
"recipes" for addressing a number of common analytics tasks to provide
inspiration for your own analysis. We generally provide examples for [resilient
distributed datasets
(RDD)](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html) in
Scala, and
[DataFrames](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html#datasets-and-dataframes)
in both Scala and Python. We leave it up to you to choose Scala or Python
flavours of Spark.

If you want to learn more about [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), we
highly recommend [Spark: The Definitive
Guide](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034957.do)
