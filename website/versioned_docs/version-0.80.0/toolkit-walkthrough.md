Welcome to the Archives Unleashed Toolkit hands-on walkthrough!

![Spark Terminal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/218561/73990154-4d1bd800-4916-11ea-9b6e-10e4503dfa38.png)

The reality of any hands-on workshop is that things will break. We've tried our
best to provide a robust environment that can let you walk through the basics
of the Archives Unleashed Toolkit alongside us.

If you have any questions, let us know in [Slack](http://slack.archivesunleashed.org/)!

## Installation and Use

**Got Docker?**
This lesson requires that you install
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker). We have instructions on how to
install Docker
[here](https://github.com/archivesunleashed/docker-aut/wiki/Docker-Install-Instructions).

Later in this lesson, we use the networking tool [Gephi](https://gephi.org/).

Make sure that Docker is running! If it isn't, you might see an error like
`docker: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is
the docker daemon running?` – make sure to run it (on Mac, for example, you
need to run the Docker application itself).

Make a directory in your userspace, somewhere where you can find it, on your desktop
perhaps. Call it `data`. In my case, I will create it on my desktop
and it will have a path like `/Users/ianmilligan1/desktop/data`.

Use the following command, replacing `/path/to/your/data` with the directory.
**If you want to use your own ARC or WARC files, please put them in this
directory**.

`docker run --rm -it -v "/path/to/your/data:/data" archivesunleashed/docker-aut:latest`

For example, if your files are in `/Users/ianmilligan1/desktop/data` you would
run the above command like:

`docker run --rm -it -v "/Users/ianmilligan1/desktop/data:/data" archivesunleashed/docker-aut:latest`

<hr />

**Troubleshooting Tips**

The above commands are important, as they make the rest of the lesson possible!

Remember that you need to have the second `:/data` in the above example. This
is making a connection between the directory called "data" on my desktop with a
directory in the Docker virtual machine called "docker."

Also, if you are using Windows, you will need to provide the path as it appears
in your file system. For example: `C:\Users\ianmilligan1\data`.
<hr />

Once you run this command, you will have to wait a few minutes while data is
downloaded and AUT builds. Once it is all working, you should see:

```shell

      ____              __

```

## Hello World: Our First Script

Now that we are at the prompt, let's get used to running commands. The easiest
way to use the Spark Shell is to _copy and paste_ scripts that you've written
somewhere else in.

Fortunately, the Spark Shell supports this functionality!

At the `scala>` prompt, type the following command and press enter.

```shell
:paste
```

Now cut and paste the following script:

```scala
import io.archivesunleashed._
import io.archivesunleashed.udfs._

RecordLoader.loadArchives("/aut-resources/Sample-Data/*.gz", sc)
  .all()
  .keepValidPagesDF()
  .groupBy(extractDomain($"url").alias("domain"))
  .count()
  .sort($"count".desc)
  .show(10, false)
```

Let's take a moment to look at this script. It:

- begins by importing the AUT libraries;
- tells the program where it can find the data (in this case, the sample data
  that we have included in this Docker image);
- tells it only to keep the
  "[valid](https://aut.docs.archivesunleashed.org/docs/filters-rdd#scala-df)"
  pages, in this case HTML data
- tells it to `ExtractDomain`, or find the base domain of each URL - i.e.
  `www.google.com/cats` we are interested just in the domain, or
  `www.google.com`;
- counts them - how many times does `www.google.com` appear in this collection,
  for example;
- and displays a DataFrame of the top ten!

Once it is pasted in, let's run it.

You run pasted scripts by pressing `ctrl` + `d`. Try that now.

You should see:

```dataframe
// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

+-------------------------+-----+
|domain                   |count|
+-------------------------+-----+
|www.equalvoice.ca        |4274 |
|www.liberal.ca           |1968 |
|www.policyalternatives.ca|588  |
|greenparty.ca            |535  |
|www.fairvote.ca          |442  |
|www.ndp.ca               |416  |
|www.davidsuzuki.org      |348  |
|www.canadiancrc.com      |88   |
|communist-party.ca       |39   |
|www.ccsd.ca              |22   |
+-------------------------+-----+
only showing top 10 rows

import io.archivesunleashed._
import io.archivesunleashed.udfs._
```

We like to use this example for two reasons:

- It is fairly simple and lets us know that AUT is working;
- and it tells us what we can expect to find in the web archives! In this case,
  we have a lot of the Liberal Party of Canada, Equal Voice Canada, and the
  Green Party of Canada.

**If you loaded your own data above**, you can access that directory by
substituting the directory in the `loadArchives` command. Try it again!
Remember to type `:paste`, paste the following command in, and then `ctrl` +
`D` to execute.

```scala
import io.archivesunleashed._
import io.archivesunleashed.udfs._

RecordLoader.loadArchives("/data/*.gz", sc)
  .all()
  .keepValidPagesDF()
  .groupBy(extractDomain($"url").alias("domain"))
  .count()
  .sort($"count".desc)
  .show(10, false)
```

## Extracting some Text

Now that we know what we might find in a web archive, let us try extracting
some text. You might want to get just the text of a given website or domain,
for example.

Above we learned that the Liberal Party of Canada's website has 1,968 captures
in the sample files we provided. Let's try to just extract that text.

To load this script, remember to type `:paste`, copy-and-paste it into the shell,
and then press `ctrl` + `d`.

```scala
import io.archivesunleashed._
import io.archivesunleashed.udfs._

val domains = Set("www.liberal.ca")

RecordLoader.loadArchives("/aut-resources/Sample-Data/*.gz", sc)
  .webpages()
  .select($"crawl_date", extractDomain($"url").alias("domain"), $"url", $"content")
  .filter(hasDomains($"domain", lit(domains)))
  .write.csv("/data/liberal-party-text")
```

**If you're using your own data, that's why the domain count was key!** Swap
out the "liberal.ca" command above with the domain that you want to look at
from your own data.

Now let's look at the ensuing data. Go to the folder you provided in the very
first startup – remember, in my case it was `/users/ianmilligan1/desktop/data`,
and you will now have a folder called `liberal-party-text`. Open up the files
with your text editor and check it out!

## Ouch: Our First Error

One of the vexing parts of this interface is that it creates output directories
and if the directory already exists, it comes tumbling down.

As this is one of the most common errors, let's see it and then learn how to
get around it.

Try running the **exact same script** that you did above.

```scala
import io.archivesunleashed._
import io.archivesunleashed.udfs._

val domains = Set("www.liberal.ca")

RecordLoader.loadArchives("/aut-resources/Sample-Data/*.gz", sc)
  .webpages()
  .select($"crawl_date", extractDomain($"url").alias("domain"), $"url", $"content")
  .filter(hasDomains($"domain", lit(domains)))
  .write.csv("/data/liberal-party-text")
```

Instead of a nice crisp feeling of success, you will see a long dump of text
beginning with:

```scala
20/02/06 23:43:05 WARN SparkSession$Builder: Using an existing SparkSession; some configuration may not take effect.
org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: path file:/data/liberal-party-text already exists.;
```

To get around this, you can do two things:

- Delete the existing directory that you created;
- Change the name of the output file - to `/data/liberal-party-text-2` for example.

Good luck!

## Other Text Analysis Filters

Take some time to explore the various filters that you can use. Check out the
[documentation](https://aut.docs.archivesunleashed.org/docs/filters-df)
for some ideas.

Some options:

- **Keep URL Patterns**: Instead of domains, what if you wanted to have text
  relating to just a certain pattern? Substitute `hasDomains` for a command
  like:
  `.filter(extractDomain($"url"), Array("(?i)http://geocities.com/EnchantedForest/.*"))`
- **Filter by Date**: What if we just wanted data from 2006? You could add the
  following command after `.webpages()`: `.filter(hasDates($"crawl_date", Array("2006")))`
- **Filter by Language**: What if you just want French-language pages? Add
  another filter: `.filter($"languages", Array("fr")))`.

For example, if we just wanted the French-language Liberal pages, we would run:

```scala
import io.archivesunleashed._
import io.archivesunleashed.udfs._

val domains = Set("www.liberal.ca")
val languages = Set("fr")

RecordLoader.loadArchives("/aut-resources/Sample-Data/*.gz", sc)
  .webpages()
  .filter(hasDomains(extractDomain($"url"), lit(domains)))
  .filter(hasLanguages($"language", lit(languages)))
  .select($"crawl_date", extractDomain($"url").alias("domain"), $"url", $"content")
  .write.csv("/data/liberal-party-french-text")
```

Or if we wanted to just have pages from 2006, we would run:

```scala
import io.archivesunleashed._
import io.archivesunleashed.udfs._

val dates = Array("2006")

RecordLoader.loadArchives("/aut-resources/Sample-Data/*.gz", sc)
  .webpages()
  .filter(hasDate($"crawl_date", lit(dates)))
  .select($"crawl_date", extractDomain($"url").alias("domain"), $"url", $"content")
  .write.csv("/data/2006-text")
```

Finally, if we want to remove the HTTP headers – let's say if we want to create
some nice word clouds – we can add a final command: `RemoveHttpHeader`.

```scala
import io.archivesunleashed._
import io.archivesunleashed.udfs._

RecordLoader.loadArchives("/aut-resources/Sample-Data/*.gz", sc)
  .webpages()
  .select($"crawl_date", extractDomain($"url").alias("domain"), $"url", $"content")
  .write.csv("/data/text-no-headers")
```

You could now try uploading one of the plain text files using a website like
[Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org).

## Web of Links: Network Analysis

One other thing we can do is a network analysis. By now you are probably
getting good at running code.

Let's extract all of the links from the sample data and export them to a file
format that the popular network analysis program Gephi can use.

```scala
import io.archivesunleashed._
import io.archivesunleashed.udfs._
import io.archivesunleashed.app._

val webgraph = RecordLoader.loadArchives("/aut-resources/Sample-Data/*.gz", sc).webgraph()

val graph = webgraph.groupBy(
                            $"crawl_date",
                            removePrefixWWW(extractDomain($"src")).as("src_domain"),
                            removePrefixWWW(extractDomain($"dest")).as("dest_domain"))
                    .count()
                    .filter(!($"dest_domain"===""))
                    .filter(!($"src_domain"===""))
                    .filter($"count" > 5)
                    .orderBy(desc("count"))

WriteGEXF(graph.collect(), "/data/links-for-gephi.gexf")
```

By now this should be seeming pretty straightforward! (remember to keep using
`:paste` to enter this code).

## Working with the Data

The first step should be to work with this network diagram so you can make a
beautiful visualization yourself.

![Gephi visualization](https://archivesunleashed.org/images/gephi.png)

First, let's use these instructions to [work with Gephi](https://cloud.archivesunleashed.org/derivatives/gephi).

Secondly, we can begin to think about how” to work with the plain text file.
See the following documents from our "learning guides":

- [**Filtering the Full-Text Derivative
  File**](https://cloud.archivesunleashed.org/derivatives/text-filtering): This
  tutorial explores the use of the "grep" command line tool to filter out
  dates, domains, and keywords from plain text.
- [**Text Analysis Part One: Beyond the Keyword Search: Using
  AntConc**](https://cloud.archivesunleashed.org/derivatives/text-antconc):
  This tutorial explores how you can explore text within a web archive using
  the AntConc tool.
- [**Text Analysis Part Two: Sentiment Analysis With the Natural Language
  Toolkit**](https://cloud.archivesunleashed.org/derivatives/text-sentiment):
  This tutorial explores how you can calculate the positivity or negativity (in
  an emotional sense) of web archive text.

Good luck and thanks for joining us on this lesson plan.
