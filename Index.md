The Archives Unleashed Toolkit is an open-source platform for analyzing web archives built on [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/). Tight integration with Hadoop provides powerful tools for analytics and data processing via [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/).

## Table of Contents

Our documentation is divided into several main sections, which cover the Archives Unleashed Toolkit workflow from analyzing collections to understanding and working with the results.

## Further Reading

The toolkit grew out of a previous project called [Warcbase](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase). The following article provides a nice overview, much of which is still relevant:
