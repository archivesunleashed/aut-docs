# Analyzing Web Archives with Spark

### Setup

If you need assistance with setting up Spark, please visit [this walkthrough](./Installing-and-Running-Spark-under-OS-X/).

Scripts are written in Scala. For a quick introduction to the language, [Programming in Scala](http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/index.html) by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon, and Bill Venners is a good introduction. However, for the most part you should be able to adapt and extend the scripts that we provide in this guide.

### Collection Level Analytics

[Collection Level Analytics](./Spark-Collection-Analytics/): Use Spark Notebook to generate an interactive visualization of what's in your collections.

### Textual Analysis

[Extracting Domain Level Plain Text](./Spark-Extracting-Domain-Level-Plain-Text/): This command extracts plain text from a collection of ARC or WARC files, either by date, domain, or through other filters you might specify.

### Network Analysis

[Analysis of Site Link Structure](./Spark-Analysis-of-Site-Link-Structure/): This command generates aggregated site link structure from a collection of ARC or WARC files.
